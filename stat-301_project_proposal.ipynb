Although it would be convenient to convert this variable year that the game was released, that would not be a true continuous variable since years are mostly discrete (especially in the case of Steam games, where the data available is fairly recent). Hence, we will need to convert `ReleaseDate` to a continuous variable representing the number of days passed since January 1st, 1970. This is a common representation of time in computers. \n",
