# STAT-301-Project

Project for the course *STAT 301: Statistical Modelling for Data Science* at UBC. 

In this project, we will predict the Metacritic score of Steam games (the response variable) released after the year 1970, based on input variables such as the price, the number of recommendations, and release date of a game. The project will be focused on prediction and not inference, as our main goal is to predict the game's Metacritic Score.

Please see the file *stat-301_final_report.ipynb* for the finished project.
